# Coderbyte-SearchingChallenge

 Have the function Searching Challenge(str) take the str parameter being passed,
 which will contain only alphabetic characters and spaces, and return the first non-repeating character.
 For example: if string is "agettkgaeee" then your program should return k.
 The string will always contain at least one character and there will always be at least one non-repeating character.
